<p>Since I felt that a lot of other places were just too disorganized or didnâ€™t have a very updated collection of bike frames and components, I knew that this was the best way to go about fixing the whole issue of always wondering how you can make your bike lighter. And yes I am aware that places like <a href="https://weightweenies.starbike.com">Weight Weenies</a> exist, but I feel that their databases are too outdated and have become hidden in the shadows of the forum. (Despite this, I do acknowledge them as a valuable resource and I recommend their site if you canâ€™t find what you need here).</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot that can add to a bikeâ€™s weight. But things like bolts, skewers, and the like are not as important. Thatâ€™s what websites like Weight Weenies are for. This website focuses on the larger contributors towards a bikeâ€™s weight such as wheels, the frame, and the group set. Additionally, by spending less time cataloging types of screws and more time researching frames will prove to keep the information here more up to date.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-can-contribute">How you can contribute</h2>
<p>Yes. This is a large project. If you know how to use Jekyll and GitHub pages, feel free to make any additions (I would appreciate the assistance). Thereâ€™s a link at the bottom of this page to the repo.</p>
