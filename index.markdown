# Welcome to the **Saving Grams** database
 Since I felt that a lot of other places were just too disorganized or didn't have a very updated collection of bike frames and components, I knew that this was the best way to go about fixing the whole issue of always wondering how you can make your bike lighter.
 
## How you can contribute
Yes. This is a large project. If you know how to use Jekyll and GitHub pages, feel free to make any additions (I would appreciate the assistance). There's a link at the bottom of this page to the repo.
